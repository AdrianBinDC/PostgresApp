Postgres.app is the easiest way to get started with PostgreSQL on the Mac. Open the app, and you have a PostgreSQL server ready and awaiting new connections. Close the app, and the server shuts down.

Whether you're a command line aficionado, prefer GUIs, or just want to start making things with your framework of choice, connecting to Postgres.app is easy.
